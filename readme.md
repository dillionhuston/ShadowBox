# ShadowBox 📦

**Secure & Private Cloud Storage**

---

## 🚀 Overview

> ⚠️ **Prototype Warning**: ShadowBox is in early development. Avoid using it for sensitive or production data.

ShadowBox is a **privacy-first**, **encrypted** cloud storage solution built with **Python**, **Flask**, and **SQL**. Designed for security and scalability, it leverages **object-oriented programming** principles to ensure maintainability. Our vision is a decentralized, secure file-sharing platform that puts user control first.

---

## 🌲 Branches

- `main`: Functional prototype. Expect some rough edges.
- `ShadowBox-V2`: Work-in-progress refactor. Cleaner, more scalable architecture.

## 🎯 Core Features (MVP)

- 🔒 **AES-256 Encrypted File Uploads**
- 🧑‍💻 **User Authentication & File Ownership**
- 📂 **Secure File Storage & Retrieval**
- ⏰ **Expiring Links & Access Controls**
- 🛠️ **Modular OOP Architecture**
