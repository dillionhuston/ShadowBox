# 📦 ShadowBox – Secure & Private Cloud Storage

## 🚀 Overview
THIS IS A PROTOTYPE. DONT USE FOR SENSITIVE DATA
ShadowBox is a **privacy-first, decentralized cloud storage** platform that lets users securely store and share files without relying on big tech companies. Built with **end-to-end encryption, peer-to-peer (P2P) networking, and advanced access control**, this project ensures **maximum security and ownership** over your data.

## 🎯 Features (MVP)
- 🔐 **Secure File Uploads** – All files are encrypted before storage.
- 🌍 **Decentralized Storage** – No single point of failure.
